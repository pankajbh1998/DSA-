https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/

Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

  Example 1:

    Input: s = "abcabc"
    Output: 10
    Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
  Example 2:

    Input: s = "aaacb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
  Example 3:

  Input: s = "abc"
  Output: 1

SOLUTION


class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
        int count=0;
        int i=0;
        int j=0;
        int mp[3]={0,0,0};
        while(j<s.size())
        {
            mp[s[j]-'a']++;
            int sum=s.size()-j;
            int cnt=0;
            while(mp[0]>0 && mp[1]>0 && mp[2]>0)
            {
                mp[s[i++]-'a']--;
                cnt++;
            }
            count+=sum*cnt;
            j++;
        }
        return count;;
    }
};
